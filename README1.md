Contract Update Overview
In our continuous effort to improve and optimize, we have made significant modifications to our contract to address several inefficiencies and outdated practices. Here's a rundown of what we've updated and enhanced:

Tax and Fee Handling Overhaul:

Dynamic Tax System: The way we handle tax has undergone a major overhaul. Instead of having fixed tax amounts, we now calculate tax based on a percentage. This not only optimizes gas usage but also provides flexibility for future modifications.

Exclusions: Tax can be levied on any address that hasn't been excluded from fees. This ensures fair and uniform tax distribution across the board.

Dynamic Fee Structure: Our fees are no longer static. They have been made dynamic, allowing the team to make adjustments as deemed appropriate for the ecosystem's health.

Reflection Fee Removal: We've removed the reflection fee and introduced a marketing fee in its stead, ensuring more directed use of the collected fee for promotional and operational purposes.

Codebase Enhancements:

Redundancy Elimination: We've identified and removed redundant code pieces, replacing them with a more streamlined and efficient swap logic.

Fee Wallet Segregation: Fee wallets have been categorized and separated for better management. Additionally, we've introduced a dedicated marketing wallet to handle promotional and operational expenses more efficiently.

Removal of getFee Function: We removed the getFee function from Taxable.sol since it became redundant with our new dynamic tax system.

Addition of a new function that allows the team to swap contract token balance and withdraw to designated wallet at any point

Standardization and Compliance:

Updated Base: Our core contract has been revamped to align with the latest ERC-20 and OpenZeppelin standards, ensuring robustness, security, and interoperability.

 As always, we encourage feedback and suggestions from our team.
